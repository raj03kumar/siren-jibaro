      <h1>Siren -Jibaro | Love, Deaths and Robots</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jibaro is a reimagined tale of a Siren who gets infatuated by a deaf
        soldier who is unaffected by her deathly voice. However, he uses her for
        what he needs and then discards her. Jibaro is actually an allegory for
        greed and toxic relationships.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You see, both of them were attracted to one another for all the wrong
        reasons. The soldier only wanted the Siren’s jewels, whereas she was
        intrigued only because her voice couldn’t kill him. In the end, they
        both end up losing, as such relationships usually end. Keep reading to
        hear the entire breakdown of Jibaro and its meaning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The entire episode has no dialogue but is presented through sound,
        choreography, and breathtaking visuals. It starts in Puerto Rican
        wilderness when a group of soldiers – most likely colonialists – stop to
        rest and replenish at a nearby lake. One of them, Jibaro – the main
        protagonist of the episode – is deaf and finds a jewel in the shallows.

        <br />

        Soon, other soldiers realize there are treasures in the water, and,
        judging by their gold-ornamented horses, pillaging isn’t foreign to them
        at all. However, it quickly backfires when a Siren emerges from the
        lake. She is embroiled completely in gold and jewels to awaken the greed
        among the men.

        <br />

        She starts to sing and dance, and her voice sends the soldiers into a
        frenzy. Most of them kill each other, while the others keep walking
        towards the Siren in a trance, and their heavy armors pull them to the
        bottom of the lake, drowning them in the process. The deaf knight
        remains clueless and unaffected since he can’t hear the Siren, and he
        runs away.
        <br />
        The Siren is intrigued and infatuated with the deaf soldier, as it was
        clearly the first time she’d met a deaf person that’s unaffected by her
        song. So, she tracks the soldier up the river, and when he falls asleep,
        the Siren lays down with him instead of killing him like the rest of the
        army.
        <br />
        When the soldier wakes up, he is frightened by the Siren, and she runs
        back into the river, walking on water atop a nasty waterfall. The deaf
        knight sees that she is covered in gold and jewels, so he, captivated by
        the riches, starts following her into the river.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Siren approaches him, and they, enamored by one another, share a
        passionate kiss. However, her razor-sharp teeth and mouth hurt the
        soldier severely, and at this point, he shows his true intentions. He
        only wants her jewels, so he knocks the Siren out and starts ripping the
        gold and jewels from her body.
        <br />
        It severely hurts the Siren, as the treasures are a part of her, like
        her skin. The deaf soldier throws her body into the river, down the
        waterfall, and escapes with his colossal loot. However, as the Siren
        bleeds into the river, it takes her back to the lake, while her magical
        blood turns the water into a glowing shade of red.
        <br />
        The soldier carries the huge load of treasures and gets exhausted, so he
        stops by the water to wash his face and drink. It was a dire mistake for
        him, as the reddish water now had magical properties from the Siren’s
        blood, healing the deaf soldier and allowing him to hear.
        <br />
        The Siren survived, bloody and naked, and she can’t dance anymore.
        However, the soldier can now hear her agonizing screams, which lure him
        into the lake, just like the rest of his army, and he drowns due to the
        heavy armor he’s wearing.
        <br />
        Jibaro is a reimagined story about Sirens and their deathly voices that
        lured men into the water, drowning. However, it’s much deeper than that.
        It is actually a symbolic representation of greed and lust, but first
        and foremost, a depiction of toxic relationships between partners.
        <br />
        None of the characters are actually the good guy in this story. At
        first, you feel as if the Siren is the evil entity of the story.
        However, later, you feel some sort of empathy towards her, seeing how
        the deaf soldier used her and nearly killed her for his own selfish
        reasons. In the end, both of them entered that “toxic relationship” for
        all the wrong reasons.
        <br />
        The Siren wanted to kill the deaf soldier, just like the rest of the
        army. However, the only reason why she was ever interested in him after
        that is because her voice didn’t work against him. She became infatuated
        and obsessed with the one guy she couldn’t get.
        <br />

        On the other hand, the soldier could’ve easily walked away when the
        Siren tried to lure him into the river. However, he chose to enter that
        relationship for his own selfish reasons – all he wanted was the Siren’s
        treasures, so he tricked her into a kiss, only to knock her out and take
        everything from her, almost killing the Siren in the process.
        <br />

        In the end, neither of them are the heroes of the story, and neither
        gets a happy ending. The soldier’s actions come right around to bite him
        as he regains his hearing due to the blood he spilled into the water,
        which eventually leads to his demise.
        <br />

        On the other hand, the Siren is left with nothing – hurt, broken, unable
        to dance anymore, barely clinging onto life. Mielgo did a fantastic job
        portraying a toxic relationship in which none of the parties gain
        anything but get hurt, broken, and devastated for their selfish reasons.
